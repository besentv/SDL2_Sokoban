# SDL2_Sokoban
A Sokoban implementation in plain C using the SDL2 library.

### Background:
This project was created by me and a colleague during my apprenticeship as a software engineer.

Levels had to be removed due to possible copyright problems, though there are plenty of websites where you can download free ones.

## Level Format
- EMPTY_FIELD ' '
- PLAYER '@'
- CRATE '*'
- CRATE_TARGET '.'
- PLAYER_ON_TARGET '+'
- CRATE_ON_TARGET '&'
- WALL 'X'

All definitons are editable in include/game.h .

Last but not least: Have fun with the code. ðŸ˜„
